-- 2024: Week 14 - Store Data

-- Requirements 
-- Input the data tables
-- Identify which recalled items are located in each store
-- Create a field which shows how much money will be lost for each item
-- Then calculate how much money will be lost for each category, and round it to 2 dp
-- Output this first dataset
-- Phill Down (the CEO of SuperBytes) now needs to know how much money each store has lost! Find those values for each store, again rounding to 2 dp.
-- Mr Down has decided that any store that has lost Â£5000 or more is considered 'High Priority' and anything below that is 'Low Priority'. Create a new field that identifies which stores are High or Low priority. 
-- Output this second dataset
